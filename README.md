# excid-cicd-demo-project

## Description

A demo pipeline for demonstrating DevPrivSecOps methodology. 

This pipeline automates security checks in the software development lifecycle, integrating multiple stages of security testing. It includes Secret Scanning, SAST (Static Application Security Testing), SCA (Software Composition Analysis), Image Building and Scanning, Attestation, and Deployment. Key tools like Gitleaks, Semgrep, Trivy, and SonarQube are used to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and secrets within the code and container images. Automated attestations ensure provenance and SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) tracking for compliance, while DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) with ZAP scans the deployed application for vulnerabilities. This pipeline promotes a secure development process by detecting and mitigating security issues early.
